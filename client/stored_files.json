    "content": "Now is the winter of our discontent\nMade glorious summer by this sun of York;\nAnd all the clouds that lour'd upon our house\nIn the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\nNow are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\nOur bruised arms hung up for monuments;\nOur stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\nOur dreadful marches to delightful measures.\nGrim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;\nAnd now, instead of mounting barded steeds\nTo fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\nHe capers nimbly in a lady's chamber\nTo the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\nBut I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\nNor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\nI, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty\nTo strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\nI, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,"
